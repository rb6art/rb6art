   * getStaticProps, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses
   * it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions
   * will not call getStaticProps as only the exported JSON is used.
   *
   * We need to also pass through the Header that contains the sessionCookie or
   * this will always return {currentUser: null}
   * Because we are using JWT to authenticate calls.
   *
   * This is the route needed to communicate to the auth microservice.
   * This is needed bc we are making this call inside of the kubernetes cluster and on the server.
